/**
 * Shared key-value backend owned and lifecycle-managed by the core engine.
 *
 * <p>Modules read from and write to the store so that one AWS SDK call can affect the response to a
 * later call. The store has no AWS knowledge — modules are responsible for translating between the
 * AWS API protocol and store operations.
 *
 * <p>Keys follow a path-like hierarchy: {@code
 * {serviceId}/{resource-type}/{name}[/{subresource}/{id}]} For example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code sqs/queues/my-queue/messages/abc-123}
 *   <li>{@code s3/buckets/my-bucket/objects/my-key}
 *   <li>{@code secrets/my-secret}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The store does not enforce key prefixing — scoping by service ID is a module-authoring
 * convention.
 *
 * <p>The admin REST API, CLI, and management console read from the store via {@link #get} and
 * {@link #list}. They never write directly — all writes flow through module code triggered by AWS
 * SDK calls.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be thread-safe. The AWS SDK may fire concurrent requests and multiple
 * modules share the same store instance.
 *
 * <p>Values must be JSON-serialisable. A value is read back as its original concrete type,
 * including after a restart of a persistent store, so the type a module {@code put}s is the type it
 * can cast the result of {@code get} to.
